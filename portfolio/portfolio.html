      <h2> Writing Samples </h2>
          <p> Below are a compilation of articles spanning creative, professional, and technical writing. Some of these writing samples are from previous internship experiences, others are from class projects, and some I have created in my free time. I truly enjoy the written word and would love to talk further about any of these. </p>
