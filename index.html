              <h2> Welcome To My Website, Created From Scratch Using HTML! </h2>

   &nbsp;
      
   <div> <p>
   Writing has been my passion for as long as I can remember. As a Technical Writing & Communications major at Carnegie Mellon University, I have learned how to use the written word to create innovative solutions to everyday problems. Now, my interests span english, technology, robotics, aerospace, business, and more! </p>
      
<p> My story starts as a competitive debater at my high school in New York. Speech & Debate was a transformative life experience for me, teaching me the importance of public speaking, "thinking off the cuff," and "getting smart quickly."</p>
    
<p> I'm always looking for opportunities in any industry which allows me to "put my heart into the work" (an Andrew Carnegie motto)! In my free time, I enjoy running, cooking, innovating, and creative writing.</p>
       
<p> My interdisciplinary experience has allowed me to pursue opportunities in various fields. I interned at the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle in summer 2021, Salesforce in summer 2022, IBM in summer 2023, and will be joining Ansys in fall 2023. </p> </div>
